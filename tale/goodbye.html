                The muted light of morning spills down the coulees . A beige 1967 Chrysler New Yorker pulls into the
                parking lot; the necessities of life are stacked puzzle-perfect in the back. In the driver’s seat is a
                father, a man with
                thick-framed glasses and shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows. Sitting shotgun is a gangly young
                doppelganger—his son. </p>
            <p>The men get out of the car and follow the signs directing them to the housing office. There’s already a
                line of other first-years and their families, waiting to sort out their paperwork and pick up the keys
                to their dorms. Standing in line, the son shifts his weight from foot to foot. The father puts his
                hands on his hips and waits for something to fail his expectations. He glances at a bulletin board
                showcasing various amenities available to residents. A big sign in the centre of it reads Welcome to the
                University of Lethbridge. </p>
            <p> The University of Lethbridge, an institution too young to have a legacy. There are no children of alumni
                here; there won’t be for a number of years. Everyone’s fledgling, spunky with something to
                prove—wanting to start fires, working to hold their lights aloft. What else is there to do in this life,
                other than brandish a torch against the doom that forever seems to sweep the world? Heck, The October
                Crisis was just under a year ago. A national security threat which left the father seriously fearing for
                Canadians' freedoms. People thought the editor of the student paper would be <a

                <a href="https://www.ulethbridge.ca/50-voices/content/robin" target="_blank">treason</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Suffice it to say, the University of Lethbridge is not the father’s alma matter. It wouldn’t have been
                his choice of institution, either. It’s not that he doesn’t trust his son's decision or doesn’t think
                the
                boy is capable. Rather, the father remembers his own mistakes. He wants more than anything to protect
                his son from everything: failure, disappointment, regret. There are so many things that one can do
                wrong.
            </p>
            <p>They get the son’s key and head to his dorm. He’s supposed to have a roommate but the other young man
                hasn’t shown up yet. This makes things easier because it’s only the son moving in, at the moment. It
                makes things harder because it leaves the two men alone together. </p>
            <p>Of course it’s awkward. This is goodbye but they still have to be around each other, and neither knows
                how to act or what to say. Not that much gets said between them most of the time. Fathers tend to love
                through telekinesis.</p>
            <p>The men replace words with work. Boxes are moved, some belongings unpacked: bedsheets, an alarm clock,
                and a typewriter. A small collection of pulp sci-fi paperbacks. A sappy note from Mom that she must have
                snuck into a box last-minute, which makes the son blush and squirrel it away in a desk drawer. That’s
                about it. The rest of the work, he’ll handle alone.</p>
            <p>So they stand in the doorway, the son in the dorm and the father out in the hall, facing one another with
                some distance between them. Magnets oriented the wrong way. From this point on, the distance is only
                going to widen: the father will leave the building, get back in his car, and drive home; the son will
                distract himself with the process of moving in and the novelties of semi-independent living. They will
                try to call each other, now and then, but they will not know what to say besides small talk. It had
                always been enough just to spend time together, to share activities. Once this common thread is cut,
                they won’t know how to be around each other anymore.</p>
            <p>The father breaches the threshold and wraps his son in his arms. The son, surprised, takes a moment
                before hugging back. It’s awkward and uncomfortable—not so much an embrace as a mutual squeeze, tensing
                muscles like it’s exercise. But it’s a good hug. Yeah. A good hug.</p>
            <p>After a moment, they both let go and step back. Hands are relegated to pockets; sentiments are
                sequestered for the sake of decorum. “See you, dad,” the son says, one hand moving to loosely grasp the
                doorknob.</p>
            <p>The father nods his head, sorrow and pride at an impasse on his smile. He knows that <a
                    class="clue-text">say</a>ing <a class="clue-text">it out loud</a> will make it real.</p>
            <p><a class="clue-text"> “Bye, son.”</a></p>
