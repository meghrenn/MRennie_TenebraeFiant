    <h1>Rise</h1>

    <p>There is a quote which was originally by Dr. Arnold of Rugby, then repeated in a BBC TV lecture, and finally
        picked
        up by Jeanne Beaty while writing for the Lethbridge Herald: "No one ought to meddle with universities who does
        not
        know them and love them well" (p. 25).</p>
    <p>People have had to scrap for recognition, to fight for this institution to exist. The inaugural years of this
        university encompassed a pivotal era wherein everyone was giddy. Their worries were lapped over by the idea
        that, if
        nothing else, this would be a hell of a ride. There were lots of ideas swapping heads, pens scrawling on papers.
        "How might we do this?" "What could be possible?" "How will this bring light to the world?"</p>
    <p>My Latin is dusty, but from what I recall, “fiat lux” can be translated in two different ways. One is “let there
        be
        light,” but the other is “let light be made.”</p>
    <p>The light will not be here for us, inherently. It does not rise like the sun. It does not beam to us from the
        stars.
        It is generated kinetically, intellectually, emotionally, and there is no way to store it. It dissipates at the
        speed of, well, light. We must always be making more of it.</p>
