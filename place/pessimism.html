        <h1>Pessimism</h1>
        <p> And so it came to pass that the Education
            Angel declared that God Almighty had decreed that the worthy worshippers in the City to the South would have
            the chance of choosing where the educational jewel would be located. And it came to pass that the royal
            bankers and commercial kings and trust managers set their powerful machine in motion to crush the insolent
            opposition, but they did this secretly through their hired mouthpiece whom year after year they kept as
            their puppet in the chambers to the north. None could withstand the power of that machine. Futile and
            frantic fists flayed its sides, but it ground on and on and on until all sheep had been rounded up and
            counted; and God Almighty proved once again victorious. The perfidious faculty melted away; the student body
            seeped out of the city; a quiet came, and creeping death. The jewel had a name; it had a site, but its
            lustre was gone.
        </p>
        <p> The city sagged. Long rows of houses empty stood and stores with vacant windows. Royal bankers, commercial
            kings and real estate lords sweated in their secret sanctuaries. Where were the funds which should be
            flowing? Where was the gold which should be growing? God Almighty pondered. What was amiss? Could he have
            been wrong?"
